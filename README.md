# NERphilosophy
👋 Welcome to the github repository of my BsC thesis.

This repository contains (not all) code from my project on Named Entity Recognition in philosophical text.

✔️ In this repository you will find code on:
  - Cleaning & preprocessing data
  - Rule-based, SpaCy and FLAIR models
  - The Merged corpus (and its creation)
  
📁 I coded in many different files, and the code was a little all over the place at times. 
Some steps I took are not to be found in the selection of files I uploaded.

📧 If anything is unclear, or if you have questions about the code, steps I took, or the project, please feel free to email me at rubenweijers29@gmail.com and I will try to answer your questions.

❎The FLAIR models are not included since they are over 100MB.
The gold standard is also not included since it is private data.

📬 To request access to one of these, send me an email
and I will discuss it with my supervisor (Dr. J. Bloem).
